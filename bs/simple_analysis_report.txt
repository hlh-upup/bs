=== FEATURE QUALITY ISSUES ===

1. NaN Values:
- Visual features: 2445 NaN values detected
- Audio features: 0 NaN values
- Keypoint features: 0 NaN values
- AU features: 0 NaN values

2. Feature Scaling Issues:
- All feature types show severe scaling problems
- Mean range ratios: 14210.8 (visual), 13489.6 (audio), 60283.8 (keypoint), 1881.8 (AU)
- All ratios exceed 1000, indicating urgent need for normalization

=== CRITICAL FINDINGS ===

1. LABEL ISSUES:
- Only lip_sync_score has complete coverage (100% valid)
- Other scores have 22-27% missing labels
- lip_sync_score is constant (no variation) - problematic for training
- Score ranges vary significantly across different evaluation aspects

2. FEATURE QUALITY PROBLEMS:
- Visual features contain 2445 NaN values (need cleaning)
- Severe feature scaling issues across all modalities
- Extreme dimension imbalance (17-1404 dimensions)

3. DATA DISTRIBUTION CONCERNS:
- High dimensionality of keypoint features (1404D) may cause overfitting
- Large differences in feature scales will bias model toward high-variance features
- Missing labels reduce effective training data by ~25%

=== RECOMMENDATIONS ===

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:

1. Data Cleaning:
- Remove or impute NaN values in visual features
- Handle invalid labels (-1.0) using removal or interpolation
- Investigate why lip_sync_score is constant

2. Feature Preprocessing:
- Apply StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler to all features
- Consider log transformation for highly skewed features
- Implement robust scaling for outlier-heavy features

3. Dimensionality Reduction:
- Apply PCA to keypoint features (1404D -> 100-200D)
- Use feature selection to remove low-variance features
- Consider autoencoders for non-linear dimensionality reduction

4. Data Augmentation:
- Implement temporal augmentation (time warping, jittering)
- Add noise to features during training
- Use mixup or cutmix for regression tasks

5. Model Architecture Improvements:
- Use attention mechanisms for cross-modal fusion
- Implement separate encoders for each modality
- Add dropout and batch normalization
- Consider ensemble methods

6. Training Strategy:
- Use weighted loss functions for missing labels
- Implement curriculum learning
- Use transfer learning from pre-trained models
- Apply gradient clipping and early stopping

7. Evaluation Protocol:
- Implement stratified sampling for train/val/test splits
- Use cross-validation for robust evaluation
- Report confidence intervals for metrics
- Analyze per-modality contributions

=== EXPECTED IMPACT ===

Following these recommendations should:
- Improve R² from 0.174 to 0.4-0.6
- Reduce Cross Modal task error by 30-50%
- Stabilize training convergence
- Improve generalization to unseen data
- Enable better feature interpretability

=== NEXT STEPS ===

1. Implement data cleaning pipeline
2. Apply feature scaling and normalization
3. Reduce keypoint feature dimensionality
4. Retrain model with improved preprocessing
5. Evaluate performance improvements
6. Iterate based on results
